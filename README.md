## The Nitty Gritty Details About Belly Button Biodiversity
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity dataset". The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species, also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, these microbes were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## More Creepy Details.. 
In this project we learned that belly buttons are indeed a jungle of microbial diversity, having detected over 2300 species in those 60 navels! Just eight of those species, that were found were called them oligarchs â€“ were frequent and abundant across the individuals sampled (they were present in more than 70% of people); the remaining species were quite rare, often appearing in just a single navel. For more data can be located by following this link. http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity, This group catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels aka belly buttons...  Ewww
